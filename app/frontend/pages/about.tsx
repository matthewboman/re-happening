        <i>concrète radio</i> takes inspiration from the compositions of John Cage
        and Musique concrète while embracing modern techniques of recording
        and distributing music.

        The ability to stream music silos our experience as listeners.
        Algorithms restrict our tastes to what validates our already-existing
        conceptions. The end goal isn't to promote discovery or artistic
        expression; it is to generate profits for tech conglomerates. There
        is little shared experience anymore. There is little in our world we
        are encouraged to or even allowed to shape.

      <div className="my-[2rem] text-xl">
        <i>concrète radio</i> is a participatory installation that facilitates a shared
        listening experience.  During the (Re)HAPPENING, it is also a shared
        creating experience. Attendees can record their own track and mix/remix
        it with others. The song can be music, field recordings, spoken word,
        or whatever piques one's fancy throughout the day.
      </div>
      <div className="my-[2rem] text-xl">
        When a track is uploaded, it becomes available for anyone to manipulate--they
        can slow it down or speed it up (keeping the original pitch or having it get
        higher/lower like a tape), adjust the length of the loop, pan the track, and
        automate the volume.
      </div>
      <div className="my-[2rem] text-xl">
        The site will allow many or all tracks to be played at once, creating a
        unified soundtrack, constantly in flux as more loops are added and people
        manipulate one another's recordings.
      </div>
      <div className="my-[2rem] text-xl">
        This installation bridges the digital and physical. Too often the digital
        removes us from our embodied experience of the world. I want to simultaneously
        bring participants into their environment by providing a catalyst for them
        to engage sonically with their surroundings while also reimagining the utopian
        dream of wider connection outside space and time on which the internet was built.
      </div>
      <div className="my-[2rem] text-xl">
        After the day of the (Re)HAPPENING, people will no longer be able to upload
        new tracks. However, the archive of the day's recordings will remain, and
        users will still be able to rework the recordings.
      </div>
      <div className="my-[2rem] text-xl">
        I also plan to release a compilation album. Artists from the wider
        community are welcome to create songs using only the content recorded over
        the course of the (Re)HAPPENING. If you are interested in participating in
        the compilation, you can contact me at xor [dot] music [at] proton [dot] com.
